        <h2> Super Resolution Frequency</h2>
        <br/>
        <h4> background </h4>
        <br />
        <p>When considering the main challenges for super resolution task, there are mainly three issues existing. The first issue is about the similarity, which means whether the generated high resolution image is similar to the ground-truth. The second issue is about the efficiency, which means either training SISR the model or applying inference using the model only requires limited time or data. The third issue is about robustness, which means whether can use specific dataset to generate model adaptive to unseen data with different features.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>When considering the frequency value of the whole image, it is found that normally the low frequency area is larger than the high frequency area for the image with simple structure, just as the edge part is usually less amount than the surface part. However, for images with complex structure, the ratio of high frequency region and low frequency region is indeterminate. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Single image super resolution (SISR) task is to transform the low resolution image into the corresponding high resolution image, and every detail is taken into consideration by the model. SISR is usually realized by interpolation relevant methods before the existence of deep learning techniques. Interpolation methods, such as bicubic interpolation, are feasible to provide promising solutions for low frequency region. Following is one simple experiment to test how bicubic interpolation performs on different frequency regions.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Firstly, select one random image pair with the same content. Then, apply the interpolation method on the low resolution image to generate high resolution image. At last, use grayscale intensity map of original image to subtract the corresponding generated image to see where the difference located. The result is as below: </p>
        <br />
        <p>The left part is the greyscale original image and the right part is result of subtraction between ground-truth and generated high resolution image by bicubic interpolation method. It can be learnt that in the low frequency part, the difference is small and near to the zero. While in the high frequency part, the difference is large and obvious. This is probability because the pattern for SISR on the . However, popular solutions haven’t taken such issue into consideration.</p>
        <br /> 
        <p>One research work - rethinking-image-super-resolution-for-long-tailed distribution learning perspective makes up the solution based on the frequency information. The main idea is to introduce information of where the high resolution frequency region locating, to the deep learning based model, to reinforce the model focusing on the high frequency part. The structure of the method is just following: </p>
        <br />
        <p>The first step is to use f_net() and f_bicubic_interpolation() to generate two images. The one generated by f_net() is output from trained super resolution model, and the one generated by f_bicubic_interpolation() is output from bicubic interpolation method.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The second step is to make two filters (weight map) for building the loss function focusing on high frequency region based on the images generated in the first step. The first filter is to make sum of the output of f_net() and f_BI(), and then calculate the distance between ground-truth and summed result. It aims at using f_BI() value enlarging the weight of high frequency region in loss function and the weight should change according to the super resolution performance of f_net(). The second filter is to directly calculate the difference between f_BI() and ground-truth, and then introduced as one reference map into the loss function. Based on the two filters, the loss function is built as following:</p>
        <br />
        <p>The two weight filters ensure that the high frequency information is introduced statically and dynamically into the model realization. Applying the idea to various existed super resolution model. The some experiment results become better, and it is proved that successfully introducing the information of high frequency is beneficial for SISR task. One storage is that it becomes infeasible for the advanced methods, such as SwinIR, and also the computational cost is still quite high.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The research instance above is attempting to use frequency information to further improve the similarity performance (PSNR). However, it cannot enhance the state-of-the-solution any further. One promising research direction is using frequency information to improve the efficiency, and the motivation is that for the low frequency region, the classical method such as bicubic interpolation can perform well, therefore, if costly method is only applied on the high frequency region precisely, the overall solution would become lightweight.</p>
        <br />
        <p>One research work - <a high-frequency focused network for lightweight single image super resolution> has explored such area. The main backbone idea is similar to the idea mentioned previously, which uses the original image to subtract the one with blurring, and the left is problem the high resolution part. Combined with the method of convolution, the performance is reinforced.</p>
        <br />
        <p>HFFB (high frequency focused block) is the basic component of the HBBN (high frequency focused network). The main mechanism has 2 objectives. The first objective is to extract the high frequency region and the second objective is to reduce the redundance of low frequency region.</p>
        <br />
        <p>From the research instances mentioned above, it can be learnt that “high frequency focusing methods” could be potentially beneficial for the SISR on the aspect of three issues - performance, efficiency and robustness.</p>
